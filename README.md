In this homework, you will empirically study various regularization methods for neural networks, and experiment with diﬀerent convolutional neural network (CNN) conﬁg-urations. You should start by going through the Deep Learning Tutorials Project, especially, LeNet. The source code provided in the Homework 3 repository is ex-cerpted from logistic sgd.py, mlp.py, and convolutional mlp.py.
As in the previous homework, you will be using the same street view house num-bers (SVHN) dataset [1]. A recent ivestigation has achieved superior classiﬁcation results on the SVHN dataset with above 95% accuracy (by using CNN with some modiﬁcations) [2].
Instead of reproducing the superior testing accuracy, your task is to explore the CNN framework from various points of view.
As in the previous homework, a python routine called load data is provided to you for downloading and preprocessing the dataset. You should use it, unless you have absolute reason not to. The ﬁrst time you call load data, it will take you some time

to download the dataset (about 180 MB). If you already have the dataset on the EC2 volume, you should simply reuse it. Please be careful NOT TO commit the dataset ﬁles into the repository. In addition to load data, you are provided with various skeleton functions.
Note that all the results, ﬁgures, and parameters should be placed inside the IPython notebook ﬁle hw3.ipynb.
